You must guide me like a complete beginner or a child, and ask me to install requirements, and give a step by step guide. You can take your time, dont rush. give code at each step and tell me where i should paste it.

-----------------------------------------------------


You're absolutely right! Let's start from the very beginning. I'll guide you through setting up your development environment first.

Step 1: Installing Required Software
1. Do you have Node.js installed on your computer? If not, let's install it first.
2. Do you have Visual Studio Code (VS Code) installed? It's a great code editor we can use.
3. Do you have MongoDB installed locally, or should we use MongoDB Atlas (cloud version)?

Please let me know about these, and I'll help you install any missing pieces. We'll take it one step at a time!

Also, could you create a new folder on your computer where we'll build this project? You can name it something like "event-permission-manager".

Let me know once you've done this, and tell me which of the above software you already have installed. Then we'll move forward with the next steps! ðŸ˜Š


-----------------------------------------------------------


one question before continuing.... should i use windows or linux?


------------------------------------------------------------


For a beginner working on a web development project, I would recommend using Windows if that's what you're more comfortable with. Here's why:

1. If you're new to programming, dealing with both a new operating system (Linux) and learning web development simultaneously might be overwhelming.

2. All the tools we need (Node.js, MongoDB, VS Code) work perfectly well on Windows.

3. The development experience on Windows has improved significantly over the years.

However, if you:
- Already have some familiarity with Linux
- Are interested in learning Linux as well
- Plan to deploy your application on a Linux server eventually

Then using Linux could be beneficial in the long run.

In either case, I can guide you through the setup process. Which operating system would you prefer to use? Once you decide, I'll help you set up everything step by step.

Note: If you choose Windows, we'll use the Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell. If you choose Linux, we'll use the Terminal. Both will work fine for our project.

Let me know your choice, and we'll begin with the installation process! ðŸ˜Š



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Do you have Node.js installed on your computer? If not, let's install it first.     - No
    Do you have Visual Studio Code (VS Code) installed? It's a great code editor we can use.     - Yes
    Do you have MongoDB installed locally, or should we use MongoDB Atlas (cloud version)?     - i have it installed locally.
    Also, could you create a new folder on your computer where we'll build this project? You can name it something like "event-permission-manager".     - Okay, it is created. and the os i will be using is windows


--------------------------------------------------------------------------



Perfect! Let's start with installing Node.js first.

Step 1: Installing Node.js

1. Go to the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/
2. You'll see two versions: LTS (Long Term Support) and Current. Download the LTS version as it's more stable.
3. Run the downloaded installer (it will be named something like "node-v18.x.x-x64.msi")
4. Follow the installation wizard:
   - Click "Next"
   - Accept the license agreement
   - Choose the default installation path
   - Click "Next" on all default options
   - Click "Install"

To verify the installation:
1. Open Command Prompt (you can press Windows + R, type "cmd" and press Enter)
2. Type these commands:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```
Both should show version numbers. Let me know what numbers you see!

Step 2: Project Setup
1. Open VS Code
2. Go to File â†’ Open Folder and select your "event-permission-manager" folder
3. In VS Code, open the integrated terminal by:
   - Pressing Ctrl + ` (backtick key, usually under Esc)
   OR
   - Going to View â†’ Terminal

Once you've completed these steps and can see the version numbers for Node and npm, let me know, and we'll start setting up our project structure! 

Would you also like to confirm if your MongoDB installation is working? We can test that too before moving forward.


--------------------------------------------------------------------


    Let me know what version numbers you see!
        ans: C:\Users\donal>node --version (v22.13.0) C:\Users\donal>npm --version (10.9.2)
    Would you also like to confirm if your MongoDB installation is working? We can test that too before moving forward.
        okay, we can test. i have opened the folder in vs code, and done as you said


---------------------------------------------------------------------



Great! Let's first verify your MongoDB installation:

1. Open another Command Prompt window
2. Type this command:
```bash
mongosh
```

You should see something like "MongoDB shell version vX.X.X" and a connection message. Do you see this? If yes, you can type `exit` to close the MongoDB shell.

Now, let's set up our project! In your VS Code terminal (make sure you're in the event-permission-manager folder):

1. Initialize a new Node.js project by running:
```bash
npm init -y
```
This will create a package.json file.

2. Install our initial dependencies by running:
```bash
npm install express mongoose dotenv bcryptjs jsonwebtoken cors
```

Let me explain what each package does:
- express: Web framework for Node.js
- mongoose: MongoDB object modeling tool
- dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file
- bcryptjs: For password hashing
- jsonwebtoken: For authentication
- cors: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

3. Create the following folder structure. In VS Code:
   - Right-click in the explorer â†’ New Folder â†’ name it "src"
   - Inside src, create these folders:
     - models
     - routes
     - config
     - middleware

4. In the root of your project, create a new file called `.env`:
   - Right-click â†’ New File â†’ name it ".env"
   - Add this content:
```
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/event-manager
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```

5. Create a new file in the root called `server.js`:
   - Right-click â†’ New File â†’ name it "server.js"

At this point, your folder structure should look like this:
```
event-permission-manager/
  â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules/
  â”œâ”€â”€ src/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ middleware/
  â”œâ”€â”€ .env
  â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
  â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
  â””â”€â”€ server.js
```

Let me know once you've completed these steps, and I'll help you set up the server.js file and create our first model! 

Also, if you encounter any errors or have questions about any step, please let me know! ðŸ˜Š

i have typed "mongosh" in cmd, but it tells: "'mongosh' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.". i had installed mongodb, and it is working fine with mongodb-compass. i dont know why this is happening.




----------------------------------------------------------------


Ah, I understand the issue. This happens when MongoDB is installed but the MongoDB Shell (mongosh) isn't in your system's PATH. Let's fix this:

Method 1: Using MongoDB Compass
1. Since you mentioned MongoDB Compass is working, you can actually open the MongoDB Shell directly from Compass:
   - Open MongoDB Compass
   - Click on the "MONGOSH" button in the bottom-left corner
   - This should open the MongoDB Shell within Compass

Method 2: Add MongoDB Shell to PATH
1. First, let's check where MongoDB is installed. It's typically in one of these locations:
   ```
   C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\[version]\bin
   ```
   or
   ```
   C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\[version]\mongosh
   ```

2. To add it to PATH:
   - Press Windows + R
   - Type "sysdm.cpl" and press Enter
   - Go to "Advanced" tab
   - Click "Environment Variables"
   - Under "System variables", find "Path"
   - Click "Edit"
   - Click "New"
   - Add the path to your MongoDB bin directory
   - Click "OK" on all windows

Method 3: Install MongoDB Shell Separately
If you prefer, we can install MongoDB Shell separately:
1. Go to: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell
2. Download the Windows version
3. Extract the downloaded file
4. Add the extracted folder's location to your PATH (using steps from Method 2)

Which method would you like to try? We can also proceed with the project setup since MongoDB Compass is working, and come back to this later if needed. The important thing is that MongoDB server is running, which it is since Compass is working.

Would you like to:
1. Try one of these methods to fix the mongosh command?
2. Or continue with the project setup since MongoDB is working through Compass?

Let me know your preference!


-----------------------------------------------------------



i  have used the method-2 that you told, and added the path. now when i type "mongod --version", it shows: "C:\Users\donal>mongod --version db version v8.0.4 Build Info: { "version": "8.0.4", "gitVersion": "bc35ab4305d9920d9d0491c1c9ef9b72383d31f9", "modules": [], "allocator": "tcmalloc-gperf", "environment": { "distmod": "windows", "distarch": "x86_64", "target_arch": "x86_64" } }". but when i command "mongosh" is not working. i think, we con continue with project setup, and revisit this when needed. but despite my opinion you can tell me what to do



---------------------------------------------------------------


Since MongoDB server is working (confirmed by the `mongod --version` command and Compass working), we can proceed with the project setup. The mongosh command is just for the MongoDB shell interface, which we can always access through Compass if needed.

Let's continue where we left off. Can you confirm if you've completed these steps from my previous message:

1. Running `npm init -y`
2. Installing dependencies with `npm install express mongoose dotenv bcryptjs jsonwebtoken cors`
3. Creating the folder structure:
   ```
   event-permission-manager/
     â”œâ”€â”€ src/
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/
     â”‚   â””â”€â”€ middleware/
     â”œâ”€â”€ .env
     â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
     â””â”€â”€ server.js
   ```
4. Adding content to `.env` file:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/event-manager
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   ```

Please let me know which steps you've completed and which ones we need to do. I'll then guide you through the remaining steps! ðŸ˜Š
