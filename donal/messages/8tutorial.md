help me complete this project

I'll help you try out the frontend application. Let's go through it step by step.

First, let's make sure your development environment is set up correctly:

1. Make sure both your backend and frontend servers are running:

For backend (from the project root directory):
```bash
npm run dev
```

For frontend (from the client directory):
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend server should start and show you a URL (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

Before we proceed, I should ask: Have you already set up the basic organizations in your MongoDB database? We need at least:
1. College (top level)
2. IEEE (middle level)
3. IEEE Computer Society (lower level)

Would you like me to:
1. Help you set up these test organizations first?
2. Continue with the frontend testing assuming the organizations are already set up?
3. Show you the complete flow starting from organization setup?

Please let me know which option you prefer, and I'll provide detailed steps accordingly. As a beginner, it's important to have everything set up correctly before testing the frontend.
