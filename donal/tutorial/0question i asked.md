i want to build an event permission manager for my college. There are organisations like IEEE in our college, that has sub organisations inside of it. if one of the suborganisation plans to create an event, then it has to gather permission from all the organisations above it in the hierarchy, until it reaches the
head organisation, and if it is approved, then the event will be conducted or else it will be discarded.
For now, i only need the backend. I will plan and execute the frontend later. i think i will use mongoDB as database.
the entities that i think i need is:
1. head organisation
2. sub organisation
3. event
4. (add or delete entities as you wish)
can i make backend with python? or if you feel that javascript (Node.js or something) will be a better option, then go with it.
THe hierarchy is like a tree, where the college is the head organisation where pricipal makes the decision, below it comes organisations like IEEE, IEDC,
Google Developer Students Club(GDSC) etc. then there sub organisations called "Computer SOciety" inside of IEEE.
I need you to create the backend for this. you can guide me to do something if you cant do it yourself. Treat me like a complete beginner.
I need you to create a section for each organisation, where the pending events seeking permission should be listed,
so that when an organisation signs in using ita id and password, it can immediately see the new events that are listed and can make a decision on them.
THe event will start seeking approval from the organisation which it was created and climb the hierarchy until it reaches the head organisation, while acquiring permission at each point.
All these things are now done using pen-paper method in my college. I think i will scale it further for other colleges and organisations in the future.
I will be doing this as my final year project in my college. So I need you to clearly teach me at each stage what is happening.
I need a webapp, in a not-so-complex way. You can select the tech stack and everything. Feel free to ask any questions as you move further or in the beginning itself.
