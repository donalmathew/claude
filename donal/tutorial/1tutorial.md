Thank you for sharing your project idea! This is a great real-world problem to solve. Let me help you build this permission management system. I'll ask a few clarifying questions first, then suggest a tech stack and help you get started.

Clarifying questions:
1. Do you have any experience with Python or JavaScript? This will help me determine how detailed the explanations should be.
2. Would you like the ability to dynamically create/modify the organizational hierarchy, or will it be relatively static?
3. For each event, do you need to store any specific details (like date, venue, budget, etc.)?
4. Should there be different types of users (admin, organization head, etc.) with different permissions?
5. Do you need to track the history of approvals/rejections?

For now, I'll suggest a preliminary tech stack that would work well for this project:

Backend:
- Node.js with Express.js (It's great for building REST APIs and has excellent MongoDB integration)
- MongoDB (Good choice for your hierarchical data structure)
- JWT for authentication

The reason I suggest Node.js over Python is:
1. Better async handling (important for web applications)
2. Huge ecosystem of packages for web development
3. Same language (JavaScript) for both frontend and backend when you build it later
4. Excellent MongoDB integration with Mongoose ORM

Before I create the initial codebase, please let me know your answers to the questions above. This will help me tailor the solution to your specific needs and explain everything in a way that makes sense for your experience level.

Also, I'm thinking of this basic data structure:

```javascript
// Organization
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  parentOrganization: ObjectId,  // reference to parent org
  level: Number,  // hierarchy level (0 for college, 1 for IEEE, etc.)
  adminUsers: [ObjectId]  // users who can approve/reject
}

// Event
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  createdBy: ObjectId,  // reference to organization
  status: String,  // 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected'
  approvalChain: [{
    organization: ObjectId,
    status: String,
    timestamp: Date,
    comments: String
  }]
}
```

Does this basic structure align with what you had in mind? Once you provide more details, I can help you set up the project and guide you through building each component step by step.

------------------------------


Clarifying questions:
1. Do you have any experience with Python or JavaScript? This will help me determine how detailed the explanations should be.
    - Ans: You can go with JavaScript as you told me that it is great for this project.
2. Would you like the ability to dynamically create/modify the organizational hierarchy, or will it be relatively static?
    - I think dynamic will be better, but if it is too complex, then you can go with static.
3. For each event, do you need to store any specific details (like date, venue, budget, etc.)?
    - Yes there will be details to be stored, so that the approving organisation can review the event before approving.
4. Should there be different types of users (admin, organization head, etc.) with different permissions?
    - I think the introducing users might be complex. If you can go with only organisations interacting with each other, it will be easier right? But if you see that introducing users can be a great option, then you can go with it.
5. Do you need to track the history of approvals/rejections?
    - Yes
You can go with Node.js
If you have any further quesitions, please feel free to ask. You only need to start building the project after having a clear idea of it by asking questions to me.

--------------------------------------------

Thank you for the clarifications! Let me ask a few more questions to ensure I understand the requirements perfectly:

1. For organization authentication, since we're not introducing individual users, how should organizations log in? Would a simple organization ID and password be sufficient?

2. For event details, what specific information would you like to store? For example:
   - Event name
   - Date and time
   - Venue
   - Budget
   - Description
   - Expected number of participants
   - Any required resources
   Are there any other fields you'd like to include?

3. When an organization approves/rejects an event, should they be able to add comments explaining their decision?

4. Should organizations be able to:
   - View all events they've created?
   - View the status of their pending events?
   - View a history of all events they've approved/rejected?

5. For the hierarchy structure, let's say we have:
   ```
   College
   └── IEEE
       └── Computer Society
   ```
   If Computer Society creates an event, it would need approval from:
   1. Computer Society itself
   2. IEEE
   3. College
   
   Is this the correct flow? Also, should an organization be able to see pending events from all its sub-organizations, or only direct children?

Once you answer these questions, I can start setting up the project structure and guide you through building each component. I'll make sure to explain everything clearly at each step.

---------------------------------------------------

    For organization authentication, since we're not introducing individual users, how should organizations log in? Would a simple organization ID and password be sufficient?     - Ans: i think for now, it will be sufficient. And PA to the principal can also be treated like an organisation, so that the complexity of project will be reduced.
    For event details, what specific information would you like to store? For example:    - Event name    - Date and time    - Venue    - Budget    - Description    - Expected number of participants    - Any required resources    Are there any other fields you'd like to include?    - Ans: I think these will be enough. I forgot to tell you something:  when an event is created, before acquiring permissions from higher orgs, it have to first check whether the venue is available for a certain date, and if it is available, then it has to book it. The organisation that deals with booking venuese is called CGPU. and finally, when the event gets approved, the booking has to be confirmed and if it is discarded then the booking has to be cancelled.
    When an organization approves/rejects an event, should they be able to add comments explaining their decision?     - Ans: Yes. They can also inform the event organising organisation to come and meet in person, or make necessary changes and re-send the application.
    Should organizations be able to:    - View all events they've created?         - Ans: Yes    - View the status of their pending events?         - Ans: Yes    - View a history of all events they've approved/rejected?         - Ans: Yes.
    For the hierarchy structure, let's say we have:    
       College
       └── IEEE
           └── Computer Society
           If Computer Society creates an event, it would need approval from:    1. Computer Society itself     - No    2. IEEE     - yes    3. College     - yes (consider the CGPU thing i told you earlier)        Is this the correct flow? Also, should an organization be able to see pending events from all its sub-organizations, or only direct children?    - Ans:  I think only direct children will be enough. Ask further questions if you need more clarification.

------------------------------------

Thank you for these clarifications! The CGPU venue booking addition is an important detail. Let me ask a few final questions before we start coding:

1. For venue booking through CGPU:
   - Should there be a list of available venues that organizations can choose from?
   - Would you like to store venue capacity and any specific features (like projector, audio system)?
   - Should CGPU be able to see all venue bookings for a given date range?

2. For the event approval flow, let me confirm if this is correct:
   ```
   Computer Society creates event
   └── Checks venue availability with CGPU
   └── If venue available, creates temporary booking
   └── IEEE reviews and approves/rejects
   └── If approved, College (Principal's office) reviews
   └── If College approves, CGPU confirms venue booking
   └── If rejected at any stage, CGPU cancels venue booking
   ```

3. For resubmission of rejected events:
   - When an organization requests changes, should the event stay in the system as "needs modification" or should it be rejected and require a new submission?
   - Should there be a limit on how many times an event can be resubmitted?

Once you confirm these details, I can start helping you set up the project structure and create the necessary database schemas. We'll build this step by step, making sure you understand each component thoroughly.

    For venue booking through CGPU:    - Should there be a list of available venues that organizations can choose from?     - Ans: yes    - Would you like to store venue capacity and any specific features (like projector, audio system)?     - Ans: yes    - Should CGPU be able to see all venue bookings for a given date range?     - Ans: yes
    For the event approval flow, let me confirm if this is correct:    
       Computer Society creates event
       └── Checks venue availability with CGPU
       └── If venue available, creates temporary booking
       └── IEEE reviews and approves/rejects
       └── If approved, College (Principal's office) reviews
       └── If College approves, CGPU confirms venue booking
       └── If rejected at any stage, CGPU cancels venue booking
            - Ans: it is correct. I think we can ask details for the event beforehand using a form. And, i said earlier that only backend is needed, but now i am impressed with your questions and expertise, i think you can create the whole project by yourself (including frontend, backend, etc...).
    For resubmission of rejected events:    - When an organization requests changes, should the event stay in the system as "needs modification" or should it be rejected and require a new submission?     - ans: let it stay in the system as needs modification.    - Should there be a limit on how many times an event can be resubmitted?     - ans: no need You can ask further questions, if any


    --------------------------------------------------------------------


    Thank you for the clarifications! Now I have a clear picture of the project. Let me propose a complete tech stack for both frontend and backend:

Backend:
- Node.js with Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JWT for authentication

Frontend:
- React (for building a modern, responsive UI)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)

Let's start by setting up the project structure and database schemas. I'll create the necessary models and explain each part.



```javascript
// models/Organization.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const organizationSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true
  },
  orgId: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true
  },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  parentOrganization: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Organization',
    default: null
  },
  level: {
    type: Number,
    required: true  // 0 for College, 1 for IEEE, etc.
  },
  isVenueManager: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false  // true for CGPU
  }
}, { timestamps: true });

// models/Venue.js
const venueSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  capacity: {
    type: Number,
    required: true
  },
  features: [{
    type: String  // ['projector', 'audio_system', etc.]
  }],
  isAvailable: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: true
  }
});

// models/Event.js
const eventSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  createdBy: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Organization',
    required: true
  },
  dateTime: {
    type: Date,
    required: true
  },
  venue: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Venue',
    required: true
  },
  budget: {
    type: Number,
    required: true
  },
  description: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  expectedParticipants: {
    type: Number,
    required: true
  },
  requiredResources: [{
    type: String
  }],
  status: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['pending', 'approved', 'rejected', 'needs_modification', 'cancelled'],
    default: 'pending'
  },
  venueBookingStatus: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['pending', 'temporary', 'confirmed', 'cancelled'],
    default: 'pending'
  },
  approvalChain: [{
    organization: {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: 'Organization'
    },
    status: {
      type: String,
      enum: ['pending', 'approved', 'rejected', 'needs_modification']
    },
    comments: String,
    timestamp: {
      type: Date,
      default: Date.now
    }
  }],
  modificationHistory: [{
    modifiedAt: {
      type: Date,
      default: Date.now
    },
    comments: String,
    requestedBy: {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: 'Organization'
    }
  }]
}, { timestamps: true });

// models/VenueBooking.js
const venueBookingSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  venue: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Venue',
    required: true
  },
  event: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Event',
    required: true
  },
  startDateTime: {
    type: Date,
    required: true
  },
  endDateTime: {
    type: Date,
    required: true
  },
  status: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['temporary', 'confirmed', 'cancelled'],
    default: 'temporary'
  }
}, { timestamps: true });

module.exports = {
  Organization: mongoose.model('Organization', organizationSchema),
  Venue: mongoose.model('Venue', venueSchema),
  Event: mongoose.model('Event', eventSchema),
  VenueBooking: mongoose.model('VenueBooking', venueBookingSchema)
};

```

I've created the initial database schemas that will form the foundation of our application. Let me explain each model:

1. Organization:
   - Stores organization details including hierarchy information
   - Includes authentication credentials (orgId and password)
   - Tracks parent organization for hierarchy
   - Special flag for CGPU (isVenueManager)

2. Venue:
   - Manages available venues and their features
   - Tracks capacity and amenities
   - Used by CGPU for venue management

3. Event:
   - Contains all event details
   - Tracks approval status and chain
   - Includes venue booking status
   - Maintains modification history

4. VenueBooking:
   - Manages venue reservations
   - Links venues with events
   - Tracks booking status

Would you like me to:
1. Set up the Express.js server and initial routes?
2. Create the authentication system?
3. Or explain any part of these schemas in more detail?

Let me know what you'd like to focus on next, and I'll guide you through the process step by step.
